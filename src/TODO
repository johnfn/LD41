- distinction from "walked", "seen", and "?????WTF???????"

- some sort of notification system "congrats you walked to a new area"
- click onto any walked cell to walk there again.

- there should be "monster" cells that need to be cleared
- you can travel anywhere roads can get you

- generate monster/danger ratio for each square that starts easy 
  close to you and gets harder closer to the end

- 'capturable' areas that have some sort of obvious bonus to them
- ship to go over water
- world population
- you could actually unlock how to build stuff, too
- destroy a building?
- probably add mouse controls

BUGS
- you shouldn't be able to start in the middle of an ocean lol
