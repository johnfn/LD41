- actually show the areas you built when you zoom
- farms should change graphics when they die

- fix hometown so you can walk there

- variable meat from farms

- this area is not safe, you must SAFEIFY IT
- when you go over a map boundary you can be pushed into a water/wall

- lumber yard etc should indicate population

- some sort of population (plus yourself) that works at the mines/whatever
- little +1 when you get a wood or something
- you should probably start with at least one forest nearby, so you can build a mine on it
- you could then UPGRADE that mine for faster production

- docks could provide a permanent meat supply

- should be some indication that you better get a lumber yard quick or you LOSE THE GAME.

- upgrading could also expand population count
- shoot deer for meat?
- which you can use to get more population
- micro collisions are bad

- attempts to walk somewhere you cant should at least be explained.

- shouldnt show building context menu in microworld

- resource harvesting
  - have enemies
    - have you be able to kill them
    - have them drop stuff
  - have resource locations (trees etc)
    - have you be able to "kill" ... "them?" Whatever. 
    - Also you could upgrade your axe or something.
- stuff to buy at town

- "i cant traverse this it's too treacherous!" mountains
  - but then you can buy a thing

- teleporter
- unattainable areas + treasure
- render a minimap?
- hard to see flashing white thing on top of snow.

- monster spawns and farming?

- some sort of notification system "congrats you walked to a new area"

- there should be "monster" cells that need to be cleared
- you can travel anywhere roads can get you

- generate monster/danger ratio for each square that starts easy 
  close to you and gets harder closer to the end

- 'capturable' areas that have some sort of obvious bonus to them
- ship to go over water
- world population
- you could actually unlock how to build stuff, too
- destroy a building?
- probably add mouse controls

BUGS
- the town you start should never border anything.
- when you click somewhere, put the character in the center
- diagonal kinda poses some problemz. hmm
- pathfind should be cancelled when you press Z
- keys can get stuck in wrong mode

DREAMLAND
- a hierarchy view would be nice
