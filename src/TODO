- add player in macroworld
- two inaccessible areas - snow and water
  - start out not able to access
  - gain access somehow
- enemies?
  - weapons
  - ways to heal (i think just at town)
  - stuff to buy at town
  - like better weapons.
  - enemy destroying buildings and vague macro AI
  - walls
  - shouldn't enemy groups have sizes
  - should move slowly, but deliberately
- win condition
- you have a graphic now

- lumber yard etc should indicate population
  - also resources left

- could upgrade number of workers on a thing.

- actually show the areas you built when you zoom
- farms should change graphics when they die

- render a minimap?

- travelling enemies to come ruin your guys

- fix hometown so you can walk there

- variable meat from farms

- this area is not safe, you must SAFEIFY IT
- when you go over a map boundary you can be pushed into a water/wall

- there should be a tiny sprite where you are...

- you should probably start with at least one forest nearby, so you can build a mine on it
- you could then UPGRADE that mine for faster production

- docks could provide a permanent meat supply

- should be some indication that you better get a lumber yard quick or you LOSE THE GAME.

- attempts to walk somewhere you cant should at least be explained.


- "i cant traverse this it's too treacherous!" mountains
  - but then you can buy a thing

- teleporter
- unattainable areas + treasure
- hard to see flashing white thing on top of snow.

- monster spawns and farming?

- some sort of notification system "congrats you walked to a new area"

- there should be "monster" cells that need to be cleared
- you can travel anywhere roads can get you

- generate monster/danger ratio for each square that starts easy 
  close to you and gets harder closer to the end

- 'capturable' areas that have some sort of obvious bonus to them
- ship to go over water
- world population
- you could actually unlock how to build stuff, too
- destroy a building?
- probably add mouse controls

BUGS
- you can get stuck when zooming
  - chooseRandomValidMapPos should help.
- the border from snow to grass is actually white
- you overlap the white borders
- the town you start should never border anything.
- when you click somewhere, put the character in the center
- diagonal kinda poses some problemz. hmm
- pathfind should be cancelled when you press Z
- keys can get stuck in wrong mode
- should prob add escape hatches for do whiles

DREAMLAND
- a hierarchy view would be nice
